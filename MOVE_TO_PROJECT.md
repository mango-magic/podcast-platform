## Notes

- Moving services to a project is **organizational only** - it doesn't affect functionality
- Services will continue working normally after being moved
- URLs and configurations remain unchanged
- This is a UI-only operation for better organization

## After Moving

All services will be organized under the "MangoMagic 💫" project, making them easier to manage together!
